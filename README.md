# Algorithms & Data Structures 

Hello, this repository is a collection of all my python scripts and projects inspired from my coursework in CS277!

My goal in taking this class is to complement my more applied DS / Machine Learning projects with some stronger fundamentals in python. 

> Note: This repo is my OWN solutions and work, and I'm showing it for learning and for my own future reference, not for copying for graded coursework.
